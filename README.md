The "RISCOTTERVDIAGRAM" file shows the top level diagram of this MCU. The "EXP8toplevel" file is essentially a more detailed, verilog code representation of this diagram. 
The "MainProgram" file is the program I wrote to demonstrate the functionality of this MCU as well as my own familiarity with the instruction set of the MCU. 
Aside from the constraints file which interfaces the FPGA board, the other files are all modules which are instatiated in the top level file.
